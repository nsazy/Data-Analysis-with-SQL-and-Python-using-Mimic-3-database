# data_analysis

This Jupyter Notebook provides an introduction to the use of the SQL select statement for purposes of querying data from 
the Mimic 3 Demo Database.  Tools that are also used include Python, Pandas, Seaborn, SQL and SQLite.  Within this tutorial I utilized these tools to build a
multi-table query in order to query temperature data from patients in the MICU and show the temperature trends from admission through discharge.
